# Mathematica CTF Writeups

Mathematica isn't often used for CTFs, but it is actually a pretty good choice for cryptography and stenography challenges. And many students can get a free license through their university.

Mathematica can import many many image and audio formats with `Import[]`. Additionally it has very good support for matrix manipulation, modular arithmetic, and symbolic computation.

## CTF Writeups

### Images

*  [LSB image](LSB%20image/README.md) – Least significant bit (LSB) image analysis.
*  [Pixel data](Pixel%20data/README.md) – Pixel data and file formats.
*  [QR code](QR%20code/README.md) – Barcode recognition and simple list/matrix manipulation.
*  [Coordinate plotting](Coordinate%20plotting/README.md) – Plot coordinates from a SQLite database.

### Audio

*  [MIDI notes](MIDI%20notes/README.md) – MIDI note analysis. Manipulate[] example.
*  [Spectrogram image](Spectrogram%20image/README.md) – Audio spectrogram image.
*  [Morse code](Morse%20code/README.md) – Sound channel manipulation, data decoding.

### Cryptography

*  [Hill cipher](Hill%20cipher/README.md) – Hill cipher implementation.
*  [Rabin cipher](Rabin%20cipher/README.md) – Compromised Rabin cipher implementation.
